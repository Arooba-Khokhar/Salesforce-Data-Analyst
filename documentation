To measure and track the success of the localization project for the help centers, you can create a dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) using Google Analytics or other analytics tools. Here's a proposal for a dashboard along with five primary KPIs:

Dashboard Mock-up:

The dashboard can have multiple sections or tabs, each focusing on different aspects of the localization project. Below are some possible sections and KPIs:

Section 1: Traffic and Engagement Metrics

KPI 1: Total Visits: The total number of visits to the help centers for all languages.
  
KPI 2: Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave the help center after viewing only one page. A lower bounce rate indicates better engagement.
  
KPI 3: Average Session Duration: The average time visitors spend on the help center. Longer durations suggest users find content valuable.
  
KPI 4: Language Preference: A pie chart showing the distribution of users by language preference.
  
Section 2: Content Effectiveness

KPI 5: Top Pages by Language: A table or bar chart showing the most visited pages for each language. This indicates which content is most popular in each region.
  
Section 3: User Satisfaction

KPI 6: User Feedback: If available, user feedback ratings or comments on the help center content.
  
KPI 7: User Support Tickets: The number of support tickets submitted by users regarding localization issues.
  
Section 4: Conversion and Goal Metrics

KPI 8: Conversion Rate: The percentage of visitors who complete a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter or downloading a resource.
  
KPI 9: Goal Completions: The number of users who achieve specific goals on the help center, like submitting a contact form or downloading a guide.
  
Section 5: Mobile Responsiveness

KPI 10: Mobile Traffic: The percentage of users accessing the help center via mobile devices.
  
KPI 11: Mobile Conversion Rate: The conversion rate for mobile users compared to desktop users.
  
Section 6: Geographic Data

KPI 12: User Locations: A heatmap or table showing where users are accessing the help center from. This can help identify regions with high and low engagement.
  
Justification of Approach:

Traffic and Engagement Metrics: These metrics help gauge the overall performance and user engagement on the help centers. A low bounce rate and higher session duration indicate that users are finding relevant content.

Content Effectiveness: Identifying the top pages by language can guide content optimization efforts. Knowing which pages are popular helps in focusing on content improvement for specific regions.

User Satisfaction: User feedback and support tickets provide insights into user satisfaction and potential issues related to localization.

Conversion and Goal Metrics: These metrics measure the effectiveness of the help center in achieving its intended goals. A higher conversion rate and goal completions indicate successful user interactions.

Mobile Responsiveness: With the increasing use of mobile devices, tracking mobile traffic and conversion rates is crucial for ensuring a positive user experience.

Geographic Data: Understanding where users are located can help tailor content and support for specific regions and languages.
